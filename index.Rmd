`r if (knitr:::is_html_output()) 'This study aims to evaluate the inter- and intra-specific variation of hydraulic and leaf traits in collaboration with Marion Boisseaux. We evaluated the variation of the traits between measurements within leaves, between leaves within trees, in order to better study the inter- and intra-specific variation.  We used a balanced and robust sampling of 10 species x 10 individuals per species representing 100 individuals. We first want to explore trait variation in covariation within each species and between species. If the results are convincing, we may want to further investigate variation within and between species with topography controlling diameter variation. Overall, our study can provide a first robust assessment of variation in hydraulic traits within and between species for tropical tree species, with possible underlying factors for this variation.
