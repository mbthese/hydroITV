Sylvain Schmitt 2021-11-30 Preface This study aims to evaluate the inter- and intra-specific variation of hydraulic and leaf traits in collaboration with Marion Boisseaux. We evaluated the variation of the traits between measurements within leaves, between leaves within trees, in order to better study the inter- and intra-specific variation. We used a balanced and robust sampling of 10 species x 10 individuals per species representing 100 individuals. We first want to explore trait variation in covariation within each species and between species. If the results are convincing, we may want to further investigate variation within and between species with topography controlling diameter variation. Overall, our study can provide a first robust assessment of variation in hydraulic traits within and between species for tropical tree species, with possible underlying factors for this variation.

It also virtually explores the evaluation of leaf and measurement variation. 1.1 Species and individual sampling We simulated 100 species with a species variance of 1 for a given trait with 100 individuals per species with a variance of 1 for the same trait. We tested the effect of four sampling strategies on variance partitioning (Fig. 1.1): full sampling of the community sampling of 100 individuals unbalanced in species (25 species with 4 individuals) sampling of 100 individuals unbalanced in individuals (4 species with 25 individuals) sampling of 100 individuals unbalanced in species and individual (10 species with 10 individuals) The results demonstrate the need to use a balanced sampling design to properly assess and compare functional variation between and within species (Fig. 1.2). Figure 1.1: Trait distribution per species with balanced and unbalanced sampling design. Figure 1.2: Variance partitioning with balanced and unbalanced sampling design. 1.2 Leaf variations and measurement errors Similarly, we examined a sampling of 10 individuals in 10 species, 10 leaves for each individual, and 10 measurements for each leaf. This would allow us to assess the level of variation in the measurement alone to avoid an unrealistic sampling of 10 species times 10 individuals times 10 leaves times 10 measurements, which would yield 10,000 measurements! We found very stable measurements across levels using very different variations between levels (Fig. 1.3). Figure 1.3: Variance partitioning with balanced sampling design across levels.
