Sylvain Schmitt 2021-07-08 Preface This study aims to evaluate inter- and intra-specific variation in hydraulic and leaf traits in collaboration with Marion Boisseaux. We first plan to assess measurement and leaf variation to better study inter- and intra-specific variation. We plan to use a balanced and robust sampling of 10 species x 10 individuals per species representing 100 individuals. We first want to explore trait variation in covariation within and between species. If the results are convincing, we may want to further investigate variation within and between species, with topography controlling diameter variation. Overall, our study can provide a robust first assessment of variation in hydraulic traits within and between species for tropical tree species, with possible underlying drivers of this variation. Have a nice reading.

This chapter aim at demonstrating the importance of balanced design in variance partitioning in opposition to numerous papers reporting inter- versus intra-specific variation in unbalanced designs. It also explore the possibilities for evaluating leaf and measurement variations. 1.1 Species and individual sampling I simulated 100 species with a species variance of 1 for a given trait with 100 individuals per species with a variance of 1 for the same trait. I tested the effect of four sampling strategy on variance partitioning (Fig. 1.1): Full sampling of the community Sampling of 100 individuals unbalanced in species (25 species with 4 individuals) Sampling of 100 individuals unbalanced in individuals (4 species with 25 individuals) Sampling of 100 individuals unbalanced in species and individual (10 species with 10 individuals) The results demonstrate the need to use a balance sampling design to correctly assess and compare functional variation among and within species (Fig. 1.2).

Description… 1.2 Leaf varaitions and measurement errors Similarly, we looked at a sampling of 10 individuals in 10 species, 10 leaves in 10 individuals, and 10 measures in 10 leaves to evaluate each level of variation independently instead of an unrealistic sampling of 10 species times 10 individuals times 10 leaves times 10 measures resulting in 10 thousand measures! We found a very stable measures across levels using very different variations between levels (Fig. 1.3). Figure 1.3: Variance partitioning with balanced sampling design across levels.

Phenotypic variation, and therefore functional traits variation, will be shaped (i) by genetic heritage, through genotypes, (ii) by the environment (both abiotic and biotic) with spatial and temporal heterogeneity, and (iii) by random stochastic factors (Whitlock et al. 2007). Our analysis did not include yet raw genetic data. Consequently, genetic heritage will be both represented by taxonomic levels (species and genera) and ontogenetic factors. Environment will be split between abiotic environment and biotic interactions, here restrained to tree to tree interactions. We will not explore tree interactions with their environment trough herbivory and pathogens, besides their huge impact on tree life history (but see Van Der Putten et al. 2001). We selected functional traits descriptors by studying descriptors co-variation and keeping only little correlated variables with the best ecological meaning to represent (i) ontogeny, (ii) abiotic environment, and (iii) biotic interactions.

From these observations we developed a generic model linking individual phenotype to its descriptors. The generic model will be inferred later using Bayesian inference.
