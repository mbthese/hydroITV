In particular, we explore the importance of a balanced design, in contrast to the many papers reporting inter- and intraspecific variation in unbalanced designs. 3.1 Material We first simulated a trait for \\(S=100\\) species with mean trait values sampled in a normal law centered on 10 with an among-species trait variance \\(\\sigma_{S}=1\\), including each \\(I=100\\) individuals per species with trait values sampled in a normal law centered on species mean with a within-species trait variance \\(\\sigma_{I}=1\\). We then simulated \\(T=8\\) traits for \\(S=100\\) species with mean trait values sampled in a multinormal law centered on 10 with an among-species trait variance factor of \\(\\sigma_{S}=10\\), including each \\(I=100\\) individuals per species with trait values sampled in a multinormal law centered on species mean with a within-species trait variance factor \\(\\sigma_{I}=1\\).

Figure 3.4: Within-species principal component analysis (wPCA) with simulated traits for multivariate virtual data. 3.2 Methods We repeated 100 times 3 sampling strategies on virtual data (e.g. for two repetitions in Fig. 3.5): sampling of 100 individuals unbalanced in species (25 species with 4 individuals) sampling of 100 individuals unbalanced in individuals (4 species with 25 individuals) sampling of 100 individuals balanced in species and individual (10 species with 10 individuals) We tested 4 metrics: The coefficient of variation \\(CV_4\\) The variance partitioning using linear mixed models Other traits correlations with T1 Other traits within-species correlations with T1 when centering each trait per species Figure 3.5: Trait distribution per species after sampling with balanced and unbalanced sampling designs with two repetitions. 3.3 Results 3.3.1 Trait variation Both the coefficient of variation and the variance partitioning are best estimated with unbalanced sampling favoring individuals (boxplots medians in Fig. 3.6 and Fig. 3.7), but balanced sampling is very close and has less uncertainties (boxplots variances in Fig. 3.6 and Fig. 3.7). Unbalanced sampling favoring species bias the coefficient of variation and the variance partitioning toward lower values of intraspecific variation. Consequently balanced sampling seems the best strategy to assess trait variation in the community with both coefficient of variation and variance partitioning using linear mixed models. Figure 3.6: Effect of the sampling strategy on the coefficient of variation. Coefficients of variation were obtained 100 times for every sampling strategy: 4 individuals in 25 species (unbalanced species), 25 individuals in 4 species (unbalanced individuals), and 10 individuals in 10 species (balanced). Dashed line represents the expected variance partitioning based on the full community of 100 individuals in 100 species. Figure 3.7: Effect of the sampling strategy on variance partitioning.

Dashed line represents the expected variance partitioning based on the full community of 100 individuals in 100 species. 3.3.2 Trait co-variation Unbalanced sampling favoring species better estimate among-species correlations for traits (Fig. 3.8) and unbalanced sampling favoring individuals better estimate within-species correlations for traits (Fig. 3.9), but balanced sampling may have good estimations at both level to jointly estimate the two (e.g. T4 correlations in Fig. 3.8 and Fig. 3.9). Figure 3.8: Effect of the sampling strategy on other traits correlations with T1. Correlations with T1 were obtained 100 times for every sampling strategy: 4 individuals in 25 species (unbalanced species), 25 individuals in 4 species (unbalanced individuals), and 10 individuals in 10 species (balanced). Dashed line represents the expected variance partitioning based on the full community of 100 individuals in 100 species.

Dashed line represents the expected variance partitioning based on the full community of 100 individuals in 100 species. 3.4 Discussion Balanced sampling is the best strategy to assess trait variation in the community with both coefficient of variation and variance partitioning using linear mixed models (Fig. 3.6 and Fig. 3.7). But unbalanced sampling favoring the studied level is better suited to assess traits covariations in the community, despite interesting results of balanced sampling for a joint estimate of correlations at species and individuals levels (Fig. 3.8 and Fig. 3.9). 3.5 SI Figure 3.10: Effect of the sampling strategy on principal component analysis with T1.

"],["traits-variation.html", "Chapter 4 Traits variation 4.1 Methods 4.2 Results 4.3 Discussion 4.4 SIs", " Chapter 4 Traits variation Subsequent analysis aimed to assess variations in leaf traits among species, individuals, leaves and measurements. 4.1 Methods 4.1.1 Variance partitionning Variance partitioning was obtained using linear mixed models for every trait and each pairs of levels studied. We aim to understand how much of the leaf trait variation is due to : - measurement error, - within-tree leaf variation, - leaf sample repetitions among trees, - intra- and inter-specific variation. example for intra- and inter-specific variation: We estimated the among-species variance in our trait of interest from the comparison of the observed variance within and between species. In this case, Tree and Species are considered random effects but tree is nested in species. model &lt;- lme(trait~1, random = ~1|Species/Tree, data) 4.1.2 Coefficient of variation (CV) Coefficient of variation (CV) is defined as the standard deviation divided by the mean and expressed as a percentage. It does not require any ad hoc assumptions. It is unitless and therefore convenient to compare variation of traits among species. According to Yang et al. (2020), the best ITV estimator is CV1 when N &gt;100. \\[CV1=\\frac{sd(traits)}{mean(traits)}\\] For non-normal distribution of raw data or even after a logarithm transformation, CV4, or Bao’s estimator, is preferred: \\[CV4=CV1-(\\frac{CV1^3}{N}-\\frac{CV1}{4N}-\\frac{CV1^2\\times\\gamma_1}{2N}-\\frac{CV1\\times\\gamma_2}{8N})\\] Where gamma is Pearson’s measure of skewness and kurtosis of the trait sample distribution. Log-transformation places less weight on the extreme large values resulting in a more robust estimation of ITV. It also reduced the skewness of the data, which makes it easier to handle. We will calculate CV4 using the CV package. For each trait, we described the magnitude of intraspecific variation by calculating coefficients of variation (CV) across each species. The log-transformation reduces the proportional bias of ITV (Yang et al. 2020). CV only makes sense only on positive data, so we take the \\(abs(P_{TLP})\\). Beware: CV was sometimes calculated for n&lt;10 samples for some trait per species! 4.2 Results Figure 4.1: Variance partitioning of leaf traits across study levels. Variance partitioning was obtained using linear mixed models for every trait and each pairs of levels studied: measurement error, i.e. measurement repetitions among leave samples, within-tree leaf variation, i.e. leaf sample repetitions among trees, and intra- and inter-specific variation, i.e. individual repetitions among species. Leaf traits include specific leaf area (SLA), leaf dry matter content (LDMC), leaf fresh thickness (LT), leaf area (LA) leaf chlorophyll content (CC), leaf saturated water content (LSWC), leaf water potential at which leaf cells lose turgor (\\(\\pi_{TLP}\\)), and leaf minimum conductance (\\(g_{min}\\)). Figure 4.2: Intraspecific coefficient of variation for leaf traits across species. Coefficient of variation used was \\(CV_4\\). Leaf traits include specific leaf area (SLA), leaf dry matter content (LDMC), leaf fresh thickness (LT), leaf area (LA) leaf chlorophyll content (CC), leaf saturated water content (LSWC), leaf water potential at which leaf cells lose turgor (\\(\\pi_{TLP}\\)), and leaf minimum conductance (\\(g_{min}\\)). Dashed grey line shows the mean across species with the value given in black as a percentage. Sylvain: Leaf traits show moderate non-negligible CV within species (8-16%) except high for \\(g_{min}\\) and LDMC (resp. 39% and 33%) and low for LT (4%), with strong variation among species for LDMC (from 4% with P stevensonii to 76% with T. melonii). Leaf traits show strong interspecific variation (40-63%), except for SLA and LDMC (resp. 9% and 24%), but also strong intraspecific variation for all traits (30-91%) Leaf trait intraspecific variation is mostly due to the individual tree (55-88%) except for a strong variability across samples within tree for LA and CC (resp. 79% and 100%) Leaf trait intra-sample variation is almost only due to sample (82-100%) except for a non-negligible measure error within sample for LT and \\(\\pi_{TLP}\\) (resp. 9% and 14%) Coefficient of variation and variance partitioning thus provide complementary information, with for instance high individual variation with SLA (91%) due to species weak variability (9%) more than intraspecific variability (CV=8%) (=&gt;see SI boxplots) Results can drive sampling, e.g. \\(\\pi_{TLP}\\) ii a better candidate than \\(g_{min}\\) at the interspecific level with both strong species variability (55%) and a low coefficient of intraspecific variation (16%) All together results indicate non-negligible intraspecific trait variation, including hydraulic traits, questioning sampling methodology and determinants of this variation unexplained by measurement error or within individual variation across samples Marion: All traits exhibited considerable intraspecific variation, with CVs ranging from approximately 4–39% (Fig. 4.2). LT, CC and SLA exhibited low variation at 4 %, 5% and 8 % respectively. LA, \\(P_{tlp}\\), LSWC had intermediate variation, from 13-16 %. LDMC and \\(g_{min}\\)) varied with the highest CVs ≥ 30 %. We have two species with composed leaves: Tachgali melinonii and Jacarando copaia. Throughout all the traits, these two species expressed high (sometimes the highest) CV, meaning the highest dispersion of individuals, highest ITV for these species. We must be careful with this interpretation as we measured the leaflets and not the leaves. But leaflets may be more plastic than leaves. we must be aware of estimation biais: CV4 may overestimate ITV when the distribution of raw or log-transformed trait data is close to the normal distribution (???). 4.3 Discussion CV allows us to compare the distribution of trait values when those are expressed in different units. The higher the CV is, the higher the dispersion of the individual values around the mean. CV offers a way to directly compare variation among species with different abundances (Helsen et al. 2017). Studies have shown a positive relationship between species ITV and niche breadth (Clark 2010) species with larger ITV tend to have larger geographical ranges than species with smaller ITV (Brown 1984). 4.4 SIs 4.4.1 CV table Table 4.1: Coefficients of variation (\\(CV_4\\)) across each species.

Specifically, we investigated individual traits co-variation at several taxonomic scales: among species, and within species. 5.1 Methods We performed a Principal Component Analysis to investigate the multivariate trait covariation. Using the among PCA, a “classic” PCA, we aim to evaluate trait syndroms characterizing species strategies. For the within PCA, all the gravity centers are placed back at the origin and the individuals are being represented with a maximal variance. We eliminate the species effect to study the individual strategies. The among-PCA searches the axes at the center of gravity and emphasizes on the differences between groups (here, species) whereas the within-PCA searches for the shared-axes in each group. 5.2 Results Figure 5.1: Among (A) and Within-species (B) principal component analysis (A - PCA and B - wPCA) of leaf traits across individuals in 10 Neotropical tree species.

Sylvain: We seem to have the classical conservative-acquisitive spectrum or slow-fast spectrum among and within species with SLA opposing LT, CC, LT, and LDMC less visible among than within species \\(g_{min}\\) covary with the conservative-acquisitive or slow-fast spectrum with decreased conductance and a better conservation of water and gas for conservative slow species The second axis seems to oppose \\(\\pi_{TLP}\\) to LA among and within species but less visible among than within species, congruent with Maréchaux et al. (2020) but opposed to the result of Guillemot et al. (2022), and might be related to the stature-recruitment spectrum described in Guillemot et al. (2022) I’m uncertain for the moment on how to interpret LSWC. Marion * Among-PCA: We recognize the classic LES opposing SLA with LDMC in the first axis while Ptlp drives the second axis with LSWC. gmin contributes to both axis. A low gmin can help maintain leaf hydration status (reduced leaks). Higher gmin were observed in fast-growing species which were associated with the investment in small and numerous stomata, which allowed higher carbon assimilation rates but also increased water leaks, with negative impacts on leaf survival under drought (Machado et al 2021) Ptlp is linked with LA: smaller leaves have a more negative πtlp (higher drought tolerance). LSWC: According to our analysis, high LSWC is linked to more negative Ptlp. The absolute amount of stored water would contribute to greater drought tolerance, more backed-up water? A lower gmin would be easier to maintain with less stored water. we must be careful when interpreting trait co-variation using the among-pca as a general rule of behavior for all individuals within each species when we clearly see another use of the traits for each individual (within PCA). *ex: Protium stevensonii species tend to be more conservative-type species (higer LDMC in the among-PCA) but some individuals of the P. stevensonii explore a different strategy (within-PCA). 5.3 Discussion 5.4 SIs References "],["ontogeny-and-topography-effects.html", "Chapter 6 Ontogeny and topography effects 6.1 Methods 6.2 Results 6.3 Discussion 6.4 SIs", " Chapter 6 Ontogeny and topography effects The subsequent analysis aimed to explore variations in leaf traits according to 3 descriptors: (i) tree ontogeny, (ii) abiotic environment, and (iii) phylogeny through taxonomic levels. 6.1 Methods We used the following model: \\[Y_{i,s} \\sim \\mathcal N((\\alpha_s + \\beta_{TWI,i} \\times TWI_{i|s} + \\gamma_{TWI} \\times TWI_s) \\times \\frac{DBH_i}{\\beta_{DBH,s} + DBH_i}), \\sigma)\\] 6.2 Results Figure 6.1: Effect of TWI among and within species one leaf traits variation.

(2009) leaf-specific hydraulic conductivity (KS and KL), vulnerability to embolism between-population variability was high for most of the hydraulic traits studied, but it was directly associated with climate dryness 7.5 Rosas et al. (2019) inter- and intraspecific variability of LMA, N, d13C, WD, Hv, Hydraulic conductivity, P50 Family explained the largest amount of variability Intraspecific variability was also relevant Species occupying wetter sites showed higher N, P50 and Ptlp, and lower LMA, d13C and Hv. Within species water explained Hv and Ptlp 7.6 Kannenberg et al. (2021) popular but controversial concept of a continuum from isohydry to anisohydry. The ‘isohydry– anisohydry’ framework, which classifies plant species based on the sensitivity of water potential as water availability declines, is an especially popular approach for describing a water-use strategy there may be intraspecific variability in water- use strategies due to macro- scale couplings between soil moisture and atmospheric drivers, or as a function of site- to- site differences in rooting depth caused by subsurface variability research on plant water- use strategies should differentiate between water flow and water status regulation Trait means from a database likely inadequately represent the complex realities of plant water use, especially when such means obscure important spatio- temporal and intraspecific variability The idea that there is significant plasticity in plant water-use strategy metrics is gaining empirical support. low intraspecific variability are necessary to apply these metrics at broad scales 7.7 Guillemot et al.

Inter-species variation in xylem resistance to embolism (P50), and not leaf turgor loss point (TLP), determines the hydraulic safety margin (HSM) of tropical woody species P50 and TLP exhibit a weak phylogenetic signal and substantial variation within genera TLP is strongly associated with the fast-slow trait axis (more negative in slow species), while P50 is associated with both the fast-slow and stature- recruitment trait axes (more negative in slow and small stature species). In total contradiction with our results! BUT our results are in agreement with Maréchaux et al. (2020) relevance of TLP as an indicator of drought tolerance and species preference for dryer habitats in the tropics (Bartlett et al., 2012; Kunert et al., 2021) They also suggest that TLP and P50 are the result of repeated evolutionary adaptations of closely related taxa, which radiate to different habitats (Fig. 3, Oliveira et al., 2019) =&gt; Topographic adaptations safety-efficiency trade-off in stomatal control (Henry et al., 2019) is integral to the fast-slow axis in tropical woody species 7.8 Maréchaux et al.
