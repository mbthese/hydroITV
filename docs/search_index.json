Stomatal density: morphological characteristic at the crossroads between water loss and the maximum rate of photosynthesis (Schneider et al. 2017). Nervation density: determining the capacity of water supply in leaves (Schneider et al. 2017). Leaf chemistry? 2.3 Photochemical trait \\(\\frac{Fv}{Fm}\\): maximum quantum yield of photosystem II, which reflects photosynthesis efficiency (\\(\\mu mol . m^{-2} . s^{-1}/ \\mu mol . m^{-2} . s^{-1}\\)) 2.4 Measured traits Leaf traits Fresh - Day 1 Dry thickness (3 points) SPAD (3 points) Fresh weight Area (scan) Dry - Day 4 Dry weight Hydraulic traits Day 1 Fresh weight \\(g_{min}\\) Stomatal density \\(\\frac{Fv}{Fm}\\) Area (scan) Day 2 Saturated weight \\(g_{min}\\) \\(\\Psi _{TLP}\\) Day 4 Dry weight 2.5 Protocols Protocols to be merged between Marion and me.
