# Introduction 

We assessed the leaf turgor loss point, $\pi_{tlp}$ in MPa, from a previously established relationship with the osmotic potential at full hydration, $\pi_{osm}$ in MPa. $\pi_{osm}$ is linked to the equilibrium solute concentration value $C_0$ (in mmol.kg^{-1}) directly measured with a vapor pressure osmometer (Vapro 5600, Wescor, Logan, UT). This is referred as the *osmometer method* (Bartlett et al. 2012a; MarÃ©chaux et al. 2016).

# Materials


* Vapor pressure osmometer (Vapro 5520, Wescor, Logan, UT)
* Vapro software (Vapro Lab Report)
* Fridge
* Liquid Nitrogen
* Ziplock bag  
* Paper towel 
* Distilled water
* Metal tea ball
* Tin foil
* Needle  
* Liquid nitrogen gloves + goggles
* Liquid nitrogen contenant
* 2 Tweezers
* Cork borer

# Methods

## Installing Vapro for measurements

* Turn on Vapro the day before for the thermocouple's stability
* Test Water Quality *cf Vapro_cheatsheet*
* Clean 
* Calibration *cf Vapro_cheatsheet*
* Control tests *cf Vapro_cheatsheet*
* Verify temperature
* Always have the black diamond at the center of the display

Used daily:
* clean beforehand
* select automatic mode (10 runs)

## Sampling on the field

* Collect at least 3 healthy mature leaves on branch
* Place them in sample ziplock bag with: 
  + wet paper towel
  + Exhale in bag to saturate in CO~2~
  + Annotate bag with sample information
* Zip bag and stock in cooler

## Lab measurements

### Field day
* Recut branch under water
* Replace in ziplock bag with wet paper towel 
* Put 24h in fridge to hydrate overnight

### N+1 Field day

Vapro: 
 
* check distilled water in vapro reservoir
* clean
* select automatic mode (10 runs)
* make sure vapro software is on 

Sample measurement:

* Sample from a leaf a 5 mm disc with a cork borer: *avoid 1^st^ and 2^nd^ order veins to avoid apoplastic dilution that would lead to less negative osmometer values*
* Wrap disc in tin foil
* Immerse in liquid nitrogen for at least 2 min using metal tea ball
* Puncture 10-15 times with needle 
* Place in vapro chamber

In total, disc are exposed to air for less than 40 seconds for all the steps. 

* Record value C~0~ when the difference between consecutive 2-min measurements fell below strictly 5 mmol.kg^-1^ after at least three runs.

* If error! or Nr_Run > 10 : 
+ try a 2^nd^ cycle with same leaf
+ try a 3^rd^ cycle with another leaf 
+ otherwise record *NA*

* Beware of the stuck leaf inside the vapro! If so *cf Vapro_cheatsheet*

For METRADICA PROJECT: 

* Place measured leaf in envelop for VIENNA 

### End measurements
