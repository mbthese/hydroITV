# Models

The subsequent analysis aimed to graphically explore variations in leaf traits according to 4 descriptors: (i) tree ontogeny, (ii) biotic interactions and (iii) abiotic environment, and (iv) phylogeny through taxonomic levels. From these observations we developed a generic model linking individual phenotype to its descriptors. The generic model will be inferred later using Bayesian inference.
