# Individuals

**TODO: define individuals, using individuals from Marion and Metradica.**

This chapter define sampled individuals.

## Notes

* beware ontogeny and height
* Non-random sampling of 10 individuals across the TWI gradient
* We could select individuals minimizing DBH variation while maximizing TWI variation.
